### Comments and Reflections

- Was this your first time writing unit tests?

> No, it was not my first time writing unit tests. I am a CS major and we are required to write unit tests for all our assignments in CS 61B.

- On a scale from 0 to 10, how confusing you found the logic of testthat tests? (0 not
at all, 10 very confusing)

> I would say 1. They are pretty straightforward and very similar to jUnit that I am familiar with.

- Was this your first time working with ggvis?

> Yes, this was my first time working with ggvis.

- On a scale from 0 to 10, how confusing you found the syntax of ggvis? (0 not at all,
10 very confusing)

> 3. I would say ggvis syntax is pretty straightforward. Just needs some getting used to after using ggplot2.

- Was this your first time working with conditional panels in shiny?

> Yes, this was my first time working with conditional panels in shiny.

- On a scale from 0 to 10, how challenging you found to work with the conditional panels?
(0 not at all, 10 very challenging)

> 6. This is a new concept for me, that's why it was pretty challenging to work with conditional panels. But after looking at STAT github examples, it made much more sense.

- So far weâ€™ve exposed you to three graphing paradigms in R: base plots, ggplot, and
now ggvis. Which do you like the most and why?

> I like ggplots the most since they still seem the most powerful tool with a lot of aesthetic settings for plotting.

- Did anyone help you completing the assignment? If so, who?

> No one helped me to complete this assignment.

- How much time did it take to complete this HW?

> I spent about 3 days to complete this homework.

- What was the most time consuming part?

> The most time consuming part was making Shiny app look exactly like the screenshots provided in the homework instructions.
